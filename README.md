# Iconomi StatusBar for MacOS

This tool shows the total value and the BTC value in your MacOS StatusBar.

## Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:JvGinkel/iconomi-mac-statusbar.git
cd iconomi-mac-statusbar
go build
./iconomi-mac-statusbar
```

On the first time it will create a config file in `~/.iconomi/config.yaml` you need to edit this with your Iconomi API credentials. Then you can start this tool again and it will work.
